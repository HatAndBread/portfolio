            A musical instrument for your touchscreen device. Inspired by the theremin, but really
            more of slide theremin. Move up to five fingers vertically to change pitch. Move fingers
            diagonally to reduce gain. Adjust effects and envelope on the fly with any spare fingers
            you have left. Record and mutate loops for mutant dance beats. If you like noisy things
            you will like this.

            An application for intermediate to advanced learners of Japanese. There are a plethora
            of applications out there for learning how to read kanji, but very few options for those
            who have advanced reading skills but for whom writing is a challenge. I made this app to
            fill that void. Users can create and share their own study sets, or choose from a
            variety of pre-made study sets. Utilizes Google's Hand Writing API to check the validity
            of the user's answers.

            My passion project. Japan Adventure Maps allows users to design hiking and cycling
            routes using detailed trail information supplied by Open Street Maps. There are too many
            features to list, but here are some of my favorites: export routes to your gps device,
            find routes by location, heat maps, 3d navigation, etc etc. Try it for yourself and see
            what it can do.

            As a programmer of retro-styled 2d games, I always wanted a simple and easy to use
            pixel-art sprite sheet generator. Since I never found one that that suited my needs, I
            decided to make one myself! Pixel Art Animator allows users to easily make animations
            and save them as either animated gifs or png sprite sheets.

            {" "}
            One of my first truly big projects, S2PD started out as a very simple challenge to
            myself; program a 2d game in plain vanilla JavaScript without relying on any external
            libraries. As the game grew more and more complex I realized that the small library of
            methods I had written for working with HTML5 canvas could be used for much more than
            just the game it was intended for. Soon I entirely threw out my original game idea and
            decided to turn the library into its own full fledged game library.
