            As a programmer of retro-styled 2d games, I always wanted a simple and easy to use pixel-art sprite sheet
            generator. Since I never found one that that suited my needs, I decided to make one myself! Pixel Art
            Animator allows users to easily make animations and save them as either animated gifs or png sprite sheets.

            One of my first truly big coding project, S2PD started out as a very simple challenge to myself; program a
            2d game in plain vanilla JavaScript without relying on any external libraries. As the game grew more and
            more complex I realized that the small library of methods I had written for working with HTML5 canvas could
            be used for much more than just the game it was intended for. Soon I entirely threw out my original game
            idea and decided to turn the library into its own full fledged game library.
